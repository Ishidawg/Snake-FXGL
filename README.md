# Snake FXGL 🐍
> A game created using FXGL to learn and be more familiar with java sintax.

I've created this game to **learn more** about *Java, OOP, A&D (arrays)* and to be **more familiar** with java *sintax*. This was my goal so I can *expand* things a little more and do a *Spring* project and stuff.

**FXGL 11** was my choice because I see that the author is very compromised with teaching others to use it, the [FXGL github page](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL) has so many examples, his [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4h6ypqTi3RTiTuAQFKE6xwflnPKyFuPp) is full of videos and the [wiki](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL/wiki/FXGL-11) is kinda decent. Also, I did use a little bit of *Swing* before and *JavaFX* was **way more recomended**. There is another another framework that I want to use called [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx).

The art was maded by myself (cleary inspired by the [google's snake](https://sites.google.com/site/populardoodlegames/google-snake)) on [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) *(svg to png)*. Also the *"soundtrack"* *(sounds like a kid smashing a Nokia 3310 buttons with the highest sound possible)* that I made was using a free website called [Song Maker](https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Song-Maker).

*Never been much of a Java fan tho... but now I think I like it more.*

## Installation

You are able to play on *Windows*, *Linux* and *Mac OS X*, just access the [release page](https://github.com/Ishidawg/Snake-FXGL/releases) and give it a try.

*Note: I was not able to test the **Mac OS X** version, but I will assume that it just works because both - Linux and Windows - works fine.*

## *Other*
I have used the [packr](https://github.com/libgdx/packr) *(from the creators of libGDX)* to build my project and distribuite to *Windows, Linux and Mac OS X* pretty straightfoward.

In fact, the only build that I had problem was with *Windows* version that I had to use another SDK with JavaFX included *(since it was removed in the past)* from [bellsoft](https://bell-sw.com/) called [Liberica Full JDK 21.0.8+12 x86 64](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/#jdk-21-lts), this SDK has pretty much every dependency that I need to run the game on *Windows*.

Another tool that I use just to add an icon to the `snake.exe` was [Icon Changer](https://github.com/stefanGaina/Icon-Changer).

*The background music that keeps looping in the game is kinda broken, because it's not loop perfectly. I don't know exactly why tho...*
